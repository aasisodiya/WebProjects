## Background Backdrop Filter

The `backdrop-filter` CSS property lets you apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the ***area behind an element***. Because it applies to everything behind the element, to see the effect you must make the element or its background at least partially transparent.

```css
.blur {
    backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}

.brightness {
    backdrop-filter: brightness(60%);
}

.contrast {
    backdrop-filter: contrast(40%);
}

.grayscale {
    backdrop-filter: grayscale(90%);
}

.hue {
    backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(120deg);
}

.invert {
    backdrop-filter: invert(70%);
}

.sepia {
    backdrop-filter: sepia(90%);
}

.saturate {
    backdrop-filter: saturate(80%);
}

.opacity {
    backdrop-filter: opacity(20%);
}

.drop-shadow {
    backdrop-filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px blue);
}
```

| backdrop-filter | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blur(px)`      | `blur()` will add blur effect                           |
| `brightness(%)` | `brightness()` will set the brightness                  |
| `contrast(%)`   | `contrast()` will change the contrast                   |
| `grayscale()`   | `grayscale()` will add black & white (grayscale) effect |
| `hue-rotate()`  | `hue-rotate()` will apply a hue rotation                |
| `invert()`      | `invert()` will invert the colors                       |
| `sepia()`       | `sepia()` will show sepia effect                        |
| `saturate()`    | `saturate()` will saturate the colors                   |
| `opacity()`     | `opacity()` sets transparency                           |
| `drop-shadow()` | `drop-shadow()` applies a drop shadow effect            |

## `filter` Property

The `filter` CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

For filter refer above [`backdrop-filter`](#background-backdrop-filter) section

## Difference Between `filter` and `backdrop-filter`

|`backdrop-filter`|`filter`|
|-|-|
|Applies to area behind an element|Applies directly to an element|

## Background-Size Property

| Value                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `background-size: contain;` | It will resize the image inside given element in such a way that nothing is cropped (so there can be negative space)   |
| `background-size: cover;`   | It will resize the image inside given element to fit it completely irrespective if it gets cropped (no negative space) |

## Using `calc()` In CSS

`calc()` as the name suggest helps to perform Calculations that you can set to required CSS property. It can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer is allowed.

**Important Observation**: `calc(1000px- 800px)`,`calc(1000px -800px)` and `calc(1000px-800px)` given 3 expression doesn't work because operator needs to be seperated by a space i.e `calc(1000px - 800px)`

### Notes

- The `+` and `-` operators must be surrounded by whitespace. For instance, `calc(50% -8px)` will be parsed as a percentage followed by a negative length — an invalid expression — while `calc(50% - 8px)` is a percentage followed by a subtraction operator and a length. Likewise, `calc(8px + -50%)` is treated as a length followed by an addition operator and a negative percentage.
- The `*` and `/` operators do not require whitespace, but adding it for consistency is both allowed and recommended.
- Division by zero results in an error being generated by the HTML parser.
- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables may be treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `calc()` functions, in which case the inner ones are treated as simple parentheses.

## Orientation Based Styling

You can apply styling based on your device screen orientation by using `@media only screen and (orientation: landscape)` and `@media only screen and (orientation: portrait)`. For Example Consider below given css

```css
@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
        background-color: orangered;
    }
}

@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    body {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
}
```

Given above code, will change the background color to orangered when device screen orientation is landscape and will change it background color to yellow if device orientation is portrait. Output of the above code is given below

Example: [Click Here](./orientation-example/)

## Smooth Scroll To Given Element

If you have ever referenced an internal element in your link, then you might have noticed that on click it jumps to that element directly. Which doesn't looks just as cool as `smooth-scroll` effect using css. You could simply add below code in your css and make your transition to that element way more cool.

```css
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

[Click this link](./smooth-scroll/) to watch it in action

## `white-space` Property

The `white-space` CSS property sets how white space inside an element is handled. The property specifies two things:

- Whether and how white-space is collapsed.
- Whether lines may wrap at soft-wrap opportunities.

> [`hyphens`](#hyphens-property) might be a better solution so check it out

|Values|Description|
|-|-|
|`white-space: normal;`|Sequences of white space are collapsed. Newline characters in the source are handled the same as other white space. Lines are broken as necessary to fill line boxes.|
|`white-space: nowrap;`|Collapses white space as for `normal`, but suppresses line breaks (text wrapping) within the source.|
|`white-space: pre;`|Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are only broken at newline characters in the source and at `<br>` elements.|
|`white-space: pre-wrap;`|Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are broken at newline characters, at `<br>`, and as necessary to fill line boxes.|
|`white-space: pre-line;`|Sequences of white space are collapsed. Lines are broken at newline characters, at `<br>`, and as necessary to fill line boxes.|
|`white-space: break-spaces;`|The behavior is identical to that of pre-wrap, except that: 1. Any sequence of preserved white space always takes up space, including at the end of the line. 2. A line breaking opportunity exists after every preserved white space character, including between white space characters. 3. Such preserved spaces take up space and do not hang, and thus affect the box’s intrinsic sizes (min-content size and max-content size).|

> **Note**: To make words break within themselves, use overflow-wrap, word-break, or hyphens instead.

---

## `overflow-wrap` Property

The `overflow-wrap` CSS property applies to inline elements, setting whether the browser should insert line breaks within an otherwise unbreakable string to prevent text from overflowing its line box. ***For Example when you want to break words like `thisisverylongunnecessaryexampleofveryveryverylongwordwithnonsense`, you can use `overflow-wrap: break-word;` Property***

> [`hyphens`](#hyphens-property) might be a better solution so check it out

|Values|Description|
|-|-|
|`overflow-wrap: normal;`|Lines may only break at normal word break points (such as a space between two words).|
|`overflow-wrap: break-word;`|To prevent overflow, an otherwise unbreakable string of characters — like a long word or URL — may be broken at any point if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line. No hyphenation character is inserted at the break point. Soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.|
|`overflow-wrap: anywhere;`|The same as the anywhere value, with normally unbreakable words allowed to be broken at arbitrary points if there are no otherwise acceptable break points in the line, but soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are NOT considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.|

For Live Example [Click Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap)

## `word-break` Property

The `word-break` CSS property sets whether line breaks appear wherever the text would otherwise overflow its content box.

> [`hyphens`](#hyphens-property) might be a better solution so check it out

|Values|Description|
|-|-|
|`word-break: normal;`|Use the default line break rule.|
|`word-break: break-all;`|To prevent overflow, word breaks should be inserted between any two characters (excluding Chinese/Japanese/Korean text).|
|`word-break: keep-all;`|Word breaks should not be used for Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) text. Non-CJK text behavior is the same as for `normal`.|
|`word-break: break-word; /* deprecated */`|Has the same effect as `word-break: normal` and `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, regardless of the actual value of the `overflow-wrap` property.|

> **Note**: In contrast to word-break: break-word and overflow-wrap: break-word (see overflow-wrap), word-break: break-all will create a break at the exact place where text would otherwise overflow its container (even if putting an entire word on its own line would negate the need for a break).

## `hyphens` Property

The `hyphens` CSS property specifies how words should be hyphenated when text wraps across multiple lines. It can prevent hyphenation entirely, hyphenate at manually-specified points within the text, or let the browser automatically insert hyphens where appropriate.

|Values|Description|
|-|-|
|`hyphens: none;`|Words are not broken at line breaks, even if characters inside the words suggest line break points. Lines will only wrap at whitespace.|
|`hyphens: manual;`|Words are broken for line-wrapping only where characters inside the word suggest line break opportunities.|
|`hyphens: auto;`|The browser is free to automatically break words at appropriate hyphenation points, following whatever rules it chooses. However, suggested line break opportunities will override automatic break point selection when present.|

## `transition` Property

The `transition` CSS property is a shorthand property for `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`. So basically syntax is as follows:

```css
transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay;
/*Example : transition: margin-right 2s ease-in-out .5s;*/
/* Apply to 1 property */
/* property name | duration */
transition: margin-right 4s;

/* property name | duration | delay */
transition: margin-right 4s 1s;

/* property name | duration | easing function */
transition: margin-right 4s ease-in-out;

/* property name | duration | easing function | delay */
transition: margin-right 4s ease-in-out 1s;

/* Apply to 2 properties */
transition: margin-right 4s, color 1s;

/* Apply to all changed properties */
transition: all 0.5s ease-out;
```

Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like `:hover` or `:active` or dynamically set using JavaScript.

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|`transition-property`|The `transition-property` CSS property sets the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied. Ex. `all`, `none`, `width` or combination like `width, height`|
|`transition-duration`|The `transition-duration` CSS property sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur. Ex. 1s, 800ms|
|`transition-timing-function`|The `transition-timing-function` CSS property sets how intermediate values are calculated for CSS properties being affected by a transition effect. Ex. `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, `linear`, `step-start`, `step-end`|
|`transition-delay`|The `transition-delay` CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition. Ex. 1s, 300ms|
