## Background Backdrop Filter

```css
.blur {
    backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}

.brightness {
    backdrop-filter: brightness(60%);
}

.contrast {
    backdrop-filter: contrast(40%);
}

.grayscale {
    backdrop-filter: grayscale(90%);
}

.hue {
    backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(120deg);
}

.invert {
    backdrop-filter: invert(70%);
}

.sepia {
    backdrop-filter: sepia(90%);
}

.saturate {
    backdrop-filter: saturate(80%);
}

.opacity {
    backdrop-filter: opacity(20%);
}

.drop-shadow {
    backdrop-filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px blue);
}
```

## Background-Size Property

| Value                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `background-size: contain;` | It will resize the image inside given element in such a way that nothing is cropped (so there can be negative space)   |
| `background-size: cover;`   | It will resize the image inside given element to fit it completely irrespective if it gets cropped (no negative space) |

## Using `calc()` In CSS

`calc()` as the name suggest helps to perform Calculations that you can set to required CSS property. It can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer is allowed.

**Important Observation**: `calc(1000px- 800px)`,`calc(1000px -800px)` and `calc(1000px-800px)` given 3 expression doesn't work because operator needs to be seperated by a space i.e `calc(1000px - 800px)`

### Notes

- The `+` and `-` operators must be surrounded by whitespace. For instance, `calc(50% -8px)` will be parsed as a percentage followed by a negative length — an invalid expression — while `calc(50% - 8px)` is a percentage followed by a subtraction operator and a length. Likewise, `calc(8px + -50%)` is treated as a length followed by an addition operator and a negative percentage.
- The `*` and `/` operators do not require whitespace, but adding it for consistency is both allowed and recommended.
- Division by zero results in an error being generated by the HTML parser.
- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables may be treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `calc()` functions, in which case the inner ones are treated as simple parentheses.

## Orientation Based Styling

You can apply styling based on your device screen orientation by using `@media only screen and (orientation: landscape)` and `@media only screen and (orientation: portrait)`. For Example Consider below given css

```css
@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
        background-color: orangered;
    }
}

@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    body {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
}
```

Given above code, will change the background color to orangered when device screen orientation is landscape and will change it background color to yellow if device orientation is portrait. Output of the above code is given below
